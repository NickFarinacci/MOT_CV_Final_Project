this worked, git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git push, why and how?

The command `git config http.postBuffer 524288000` worked because it increased the maximum size of data that Git can send in a single HTTP request. Let me break it down:

1. `http.postBuffer` is a Git configuration setting that controls the buffer size for HTTP/HTTPS operations
2. `524288000` is the new buffer size in bytes (about 500MB)
   - Default is usually 1MB (1048576 bytes)
   - Your .ipynb file was about 3.14MB, which exceeded the default

When you were getting the error before, it was because:
1. Git was trying to push your Jupyter notebook (~3.14MB)
2. The default buffer was too small (1MB)
3. The HTTP request was failing because it couldn't handle the file size

The command worked by:
1. Increasing the buffer to 500MB
2. Allowing Git to send larger chunks of data in a single HTTP request
3. Successfully accommodating your ~3.14MB file

This setting persists in your Git config, so future pushes of similar-sized files should work without needing to set it again. You can check your current setting with:
```bash
git config --get http.postBuffer
```
